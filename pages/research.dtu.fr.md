title: Doctoral Training Unit DHH
subheading: "Doctoral Training Unit on Digital History and Hermeneutics: Where new ideas thrive!"

---
(FR) The “Digital History and Hermeneutics” Doctoral Training Unit (DTU) is a four-year interdisciplinary research and training programme funded by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) and located in the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C2DH). It is designed to serve as an experimental space in which different communities of practice and epistemic cultures – including historians, philosophers, computer scientists, geographers and information and data scientists as well as experts in human-computer interaction – negotiate new forms of knowledge production in the field of digital history and humanities.

Digital humanities are high on the agenda. Yet, one can detect a growing gap or a-synchronicity between the fast development of new digital research infrastructures and technologies on the one hand and a rather slow implementation of digital research skills and practices on the other. This DTU aims at facing the methodological and epistemological challenges of doing research and teaching in the realm of digital humanities in general and in the field of digital history in specific.

The DTU builds on the concept of “digital hermeneutics”, defined as the critical and self-reflexive use of digital tools and technologies for the development of new research questions, the testing of analytical assumptions and the production of sophisticated scientific interpretations. Based on eight thematic areas and a series of fundamental questions, the DTU offers a training environment for 13 PhD students and 1 post-doc.

After the project’s successful kick-off in March 2017, various activities have been organised within the DTU framework. These include skills trainings – varying from two-days to a full-week – in which PhD students are introduced to and trained in a number of fundamental skills in digital history and humanities. The subjects of these trainings varied from text mining and digital source criticism to database structures and programming with Python. In 2018, trainings in data visualisation, GIS analysis, tool criticism and algorithmic critique will be organised.

Skills trainings and workshops usually take place in the Digital History lab. In this experimental place, students can “thinker” with various digital tools in both a playful and critical manner. It also serves as location for the bi-weekly team meetings and other DTU-related events.
